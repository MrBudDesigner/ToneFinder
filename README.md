# Introducing ToneFinder: A Game Designer's Attempt to help people with disabilities 🎧

ToneFinder is a software application that can be used to find the tone/emotion of any audio file. That's the best simple definition I can use for that.

I know, you may be wondering what the hell is the use of it. But you might not get it in a sec. What if I told, you some people are employed but have hearing disabilities? You get it.

Let's imagine an entrepreneur who wants to collect feedback from people through phone calls. He has a disability of hearing but he also needs feedback from customers. What are the most useful applications he would have? A Speech-to-text application and an application that helps him to find the emotion or the tone of an audio file. A huge number of speech-to-text applications, a few of Tone Finders.
